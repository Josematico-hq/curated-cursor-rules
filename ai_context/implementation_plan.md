# Implementation Plan

## Active Plans

### AI Context System Enhancement - âœ… Complete
**Created**: 2024-06-01
**Completed**: 2024-06-01
**Complexity**: Medium

#### Objective
Enhance the AI context persistence rule to include project planning and progress tracking for complex tasks.

#### Task Breakdown
- âœ… Analyze current AI context persistence rule - 2024-06-01 14:45
- âœ… Design planning requirements for complex tasks - 2024-06-01 15:00
- âœ… Add implementation_plan.md to required context files - 2024-06-01 15:15
- âœ… Create planning workflow integration - 2024-06-01 15:20
- âœ… Update context reading/updating protocols - 2024-06-01 15:25
- âœ… Create implementation_plan.md file structure template - 2024-06-01 15:30
- âœ… Add comprehensive examples for planning workflow - 2024-06-01 15:35
- âœ… Create initial implementation_plan.md for this project - 2024-06-01 15:40

#### Dependencies
- Existing AI context persistence rule system
- Understanding of complex task identification criteria

#### Success Criteria
- âœ… Rule includes mandatory planning for complex tasks (>30 min, multi-component)
- âœ… Clear progress tracking requirements with status indicators
- âœ… Integration with existing context reading/updating protocols
- âœ… Comprehensive examples demonstrating planning workflow
- âœ… Template structure for implementation plans

#### Risks & Mitigation
- Risk: Planning overhead might slow down simple tasks
  - Mitigation: Clear criteria for when planning is required (>30 min, multi-component)
- Risk: Implementation plans become too detailed/bureaucratic
  - Mitigation: Focus on essential information and practical tracking

#### Progress Notes
- 2024-06-01 15:40: Successfully enhanced AI context rule with planning capabilities. All objectives met.
