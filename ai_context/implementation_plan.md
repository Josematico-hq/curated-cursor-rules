# Implementation Plan

## Active Plans (Max 3-5 plans to maintain focus)

### Future Rule System Enhancements - ðŸ“‹ Planned
**Created**: 2024-06-01
**Last Updated**: 2024-06-01
**Estimated Start**: Future
**Complexity**: Variable
**Priority**: Medium

#### Objective
Develop additional specialized rules based on common development scenarios and user feedback.

#### Task Breakdown
- ðŸ“‹ Identify language-specific rule needs (TypeScript, Python, React)
- ðŸ“‹ Design automated context validation tools
- ðŸ“‹ Create rule conflict detection system
- ðŸ“‹ Develop community contribution guidelines
- ðŸ“‹ Implement performance optimization for large projects

#### Dependencies
- User feedback on current rule system
- Identification of specific language/framework needs
- Community adoption and contribution interest

#### Success Criteria
- Language-specific rules provide value beyond generic rules
- Context validation catches inconsistencies automatically
- Community can easily contribute high-quality rules

#### Risks & Mitigation
- Risk: Feature bloat with too many specialized rules
  - Mitigation: Focus on most commonly requested features first
- Risk: Community contributions may vary in quality
  - Mitigation: Clear contribution guidelines and review process

#### Progress Notes
- 2024-06-01: Initial planning phase, awaiting user feedback and adoption
