# Known Issues

## Current Limitations

### Rule System Limitations
- **Context Window Impact**: Large rule sets may impact Cursor's context window
  - Status: Monitoring
  - Mitigation: Rules designed to be concise and focused
  - Future: Consider rule prioritization system

- **Rule Interaction Complexity**: With multiple rules, potential for conflicts
  - Status: Active monitoring
  - Mitigation: Clear rule precedence and integration guidelines
  - Future: Rule validation system

### AI Context System
- **Manual Context Updates**: Relies on AI discipline to update context files
  - Status: Acceptable with current rule enforcement
  - Mitigation: Strong rule enforcement for context management
  - Future: Automated context update hooks

- **Context File Growth**: Over time, context files may become large
  - Status: Not yet observed
  - Mitigation: Regular context file maintenance and archiving
  - Future: Automatic archiving of old context

### Multi-Account GitHub Setup
- **SSH Key Management**: Requires proper SSH configuration
  - Status: Working but complex initial setup
  - Mitigation: Clear documentation provided
  - Future: Simplified setup scripts

## Technical Debt

### Documentation
- **Rule Examples**: Some rules could benefit from more extensive examples
  - Priority: Medium
  - Impact: Learning curve for new users
  - Plan: Iterative improvement based on feedback

### Testing
- **Rule Validation**: No automated testing of rule effectiveness
  - Priority: Low (manual validation sufficient currently)
  - Impact: Potential rule quality issues
  - Plan: Consider rule testing framework

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
- **Language-Specific Rules**: TypeScript, Python, etc.
- **Context Automation**: Automated context updates where possible
- **Rule Customization**: Better guidance for project-specific modifications
- **Community Integration**: Contribution guidelines and review process

### Potential Issues to Monitor
- **Performance Impact**: Rule processing on large projects
- **Rule Conflicts**: As rule system grows, potential for contradictions
- **Context Drift**: Long-term accuracy of context information
- **Adoption Barriers**: Complexity of initial setup for new users
