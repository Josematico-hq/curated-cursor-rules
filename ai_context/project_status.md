# Project Status

## Current Phase
Repository setup and rule system development - Building comprehensive TDD enforcement system for Cursor AI

## Active Features
- ✅ Complete TDD rule system implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive README documentation
- 🔄 AI Context Persistence rule (just added)
- 📋 Future: Additional specialized rules for different development scenarios

## Project Characteristics
- **Focus**: Professional development quality enforcement through Cursor rules
- **Approach**: Systematic, TDD-driven development with zero tolerance for shortcuts
- **Architecture**: Modular rule system organized by category (core, testing, global, tools)
- **Philosophy**: Every rule must be practical, enforceable, and contribute to code quality
- **Scope**: Universal rules that apply to any development project using Cursor

## Recent Decisions
- **Rule Organization**: Categorized into core-rules/, testing-rules/, global-rules/, tool-rules/
- **Rule Types**: All current rules use `alwaysApply: true` for consistent enforcement
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with installation, usage, and examples
- **Authentication**: SSH-based GitHub integration for secondary account (Josematico-hq)
- **AI Context Management**: New rule added for persistent context across conversations

## Next Steps
1. Test the AI context persistence rule with additional development tasks
2. Consider additional specialized rules based on common development scenarios
3. Potentially add language-specific rule categories (TypeScript, Python, etc.)
4. Documentation for rule customization and extension
5. Community feedback and iteration
