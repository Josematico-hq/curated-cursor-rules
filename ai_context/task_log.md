# AI Task Log

## [2024-06-01 15:40] - AI Context Enhancement with Project Planning
- **Completed**: Enhanced AI context persistence rule with project planning and progress tracking
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated `.cursor/rules/core-rules/ai-context-persistence-always.mdc` with planning requirements
  - Added `ai_context/implementation_plan.md` as required context file
  - Enhanced context reading/updating protocols to include plan management
  - Created comprehensive planning workflow examples
- **Decisions**: 
  - Complex tasks (>30 min, multi-component) require detailed implementation plans
  - Mandatory progress tracking with status indicators (âœ…ðŸ”„ðŸ“‹ðŸš«)
  - Plans must include: breakdown, dependencies, risks, success criteria
  - Plan updates required after every significant progress step
- **Impact**: AI interactions now maintain detailed project planning and progress context across conversations

## [2024-06-01 14:30] - AI Context Persistence Rule Creation
- **Completed**: Created comprehensive AI context persistence rule (ai-context-persistence-always.mdc)
- **Changes**: 
  - New rule file: `.cursor/rules/core-rules/ai-context-persistence-always.mdc`
  - New folder structure: `ai_context/` with required context files
  - Initial project documentation in ai_context folder
- **Decisions**: 
  - Rule applies always (`alwaysApply: true`) for consistent enforcement
  - Six core context files required: project_status, task_log, architecture_decisions, code_conventions, dependencies, known_issues
  - Mandatory context reading before work and updating after work
- **Impact**: Future AI interactions will maintain project consistency and decision continuity
