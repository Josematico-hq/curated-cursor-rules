# Code Conventions

## Rule File Standards

### File Structure
- All rule files use `.mdc` extension (Markdown with Cursor metadata)
- Required frontmatter with `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply` fields
- Consistent heading structure: `# Title`, `## Critical Rules`, `## Examples`

### Content Standards
- Use emojis for visual organization and quick scanning
- Bullet points for actionable rules
- Include both valid and invalid examples
- Focus on enforceable, specific directives
- Avoid unnecessary explanation - prioritize actionable content

### Naming Conventions
- File naming: `rule-name-{always|auto|manual|agent}.mdc`
- Rule titles: Clear, descriptive, action-oriented
- Section headers: Consistent formatting with emojis for categories

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Style
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis on key terms
- Use `âœ…` for completed items, `ðŸ”„` for in-progress, `ðŸ“‹` for planned
- Code blocks with appropriate language specification
- Clear section hierarchy with meaningful headers

### Content Organization
- Lead with value proposition and clear benefits
- Provide practical installation and usage instructions
- Include comprehensive examples
- Structure for scanning and quick reference
